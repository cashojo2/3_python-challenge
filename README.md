This module demonstrates the use of basic python commands in two separate activities. In PyBank, a Python script was generated to analyze the financial records of a company. The script generated a primary and secondary-level analysis from this data.

In PyPoll, a separate script was written to analyze election results, primarily using a dictionary.
